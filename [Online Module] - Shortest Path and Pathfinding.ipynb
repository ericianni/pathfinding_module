    "\n",
    "To you, as a human, it is very easy to see that the only clear path is around the North of the castle, back down the East and across the bridges in the South.  You are able to process the entire map at once and quickly identify dead ends.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now imagine you are told that it is possible to cross water tiles, but there is a movement penalty. All of a sudden the task isn't so easy as you have to consider if swimming the moat is faster than the long way. Still, you can probably figure out that crossing the one water tile to the South-West is probably the fastest route.\n",

    "## What is Pathfinding?\n",
    "The simplest definition of _pathfinding_ is finding a route (_path_) between points A and B. We do this all the time everyday of our lives. When driving to the store we have to pick which streets to follow to get there. Even the simple act of crossing a room is an act of selecting a route, even more so if you have children leaving toys on the ground!\n",
    "\n",
    "While you or I use our eyes and intuition for many _pathfinding_ tasks, computers must rely on other approaches. Most computational _pathfinding_ makes heavy use of _graph theory_. This involves defining the given situation as a _graph_: a series of nodes and edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this process, let's imagine a bus-network between a few cities: New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Columbus, and Chicago. To represent the network, we begin by designating each city a _vertex_ in the graph. We then create an _edge_ between vertices to mirror the bus-routes. Finally we can assign the number of miles between the cities as the edge _weights_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![City Graph](./images/city_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! Nearly anything that can be represented as relationships between objects can be turned into a graph. Now that we have learned how to frame a problem in a way for computers to understand, it is time to actually find a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dumb\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two algorithms we are going to examine are _Depth First Search_ (DFS) and _Breadth First Search_ (BFS). These two methods are what I would call _dumb_ in that they are brute force approaches to the problem of _pathfinding_. \n",
    "\n",
    "They get their name from how they search through _tree graphs_. _DFS_ searches down a single branch until it reaches a leaf before it backtracks. _BFS_, on the other hand, searches each child node before moving onto lower levels of the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![DFS vs. BFS in Binary Trees](./images/binary_tree_search.png)(image borrowed from http://mishadoff.com/blog/dfs-on-binary-tree-array/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When not being used for _pathfinding_, _DFS_ and _BFS_ return a list of nodes in the order in which they were visited/searched. Given the binary-trees above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DFS would return **[0,1,3,4,2,5,6]** \n",
    "* BFS would return **[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's see these two in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how _DFS_ and _BFS_ work we will be using the following graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DFS & BFS Graph](./images/dfs_bfs_graph.png)\n",
    "(Image borrowed from https://eddmann.com/posts/depth-first-search-and-breadth-first-search-in-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find two code snippets that implement _DFS_ and _BFS_. You will be able to run these algorithms with different parameters to get a feel for how each search works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by simply running the cells (ctrl-enter) and trying different values for the starting node and the goal node. Try the same values for both algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have experimented, try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why don't _DFS_ and _BFS_ come up with the same path?\n",
    "2. Why does _BFS_ seem to be able to find shorter paths than _DFS_? (look at start: 'A' and goal: 'C')\n",
    "3. Pay attention to the number of steps required, why are they different?\n",
    "4. What does that mean for the value for each of these searches?\n",

    "#### Priority Queue\n",
    "Now that we can represent our map as a graph, we need to have a way for _Dijkstra's_ algorithm to keep track of our ever expanding list of nodes that need processing. For this we need a _Priority Queue_. While there are ready-made classes available we don't need all those features and they are easy to implement. For our purposes the _Priority Queue_ needs the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store all the elements\n",
    "2. Add elements to queue\n",
    "3. Sort elements so the item with the highest priority is at the front\n",
    "4. Remove the first item and return it\n",
    "\n",
    "For our implementation we will use a simple List which we will call *Q* (get it?). When adding elements to the queue we will simply append them to the list. To ensure that the highest priority element (lowest cost to visit) is at the front we will use the built in list _sort()_ function. This sorts from lowest cost to highest cost so when using retrieving the highest priority (lowest cost) element we need to use _pop(0)_. The _empty()_ function will just check the length of the queue.\n",

This is followed by two lists _directions_, which will help us quickly find the neighbors for each grid square, and <i>direction_symbols</i>, which will be used for visualizing the path once we found it. Finally, we have <i>print_grid</i> which makes it easy to display any sort of 2D list, whether it is a map, cost grid, or even the final path."

    "_A*_ was developed in conjunction with trying to teach a physical robot _pathfinding_: the Shakey project. The algorithm was originally published in 1968, so over a decade after _Dijkstra_. What made it unique at the time was applying something called a _heuristic_ to help the search make better decisions when choosing which nodes to expand to next.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why wouldn't you look at roads that headed West? Obviously it is because you know that NYC is East of Corvallis and it makes most sense to look in that direction first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about how _Dijkstra_ approaches the search, it has no concept of where it is ultimately trying to reach. It would explore both East and West as long as the edge weights were not drastically different: as seen in our look at _Map 3_ and _Map 4_ large step counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This _estimation_ of distance/direction to your _target_ is called a _heuristic_. If we know where we are starting and where we are going, we can do many things to estimate the distance. We can calculate it _as the crow flies_ or use something called _Manhattan distance_ (which we will be using) or any other way that suites our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "_A*_ uses this _heuristic_ to prioritize moving towards the goal over random exploring. So when deciding between two nodes with the same edge weight, _A*_ will choose the one _closer_ to the _target_."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Whew! That was a lot to take in and you will likely need to review much of this notebook again. I have also provided a \"playground\" at the end where you will be free to experiment with changing maps, terrain weights, or even the heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before I set you loose to further experiment let's debrief.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What have we learned?\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Pathfinding_ is all around us\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't a day that goes by that we don't utilize _pathfinding_ in our lives. When we drive a car or even make a phone call, _pathfinding_ is involved. It also usually revolves around trying to find the _shortest_ path.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Almost anything can be turned into a _graph_\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed how road systems can be represented as _graphs_ using intersections as vertices and driving distance as edge weights. Try to think of your own and discuss on Piazza!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a _graph_, we can search through it with multiple algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that _DFS_ and _BFS_ are two different approaches of searching _graphs_ without weights. We also learned that 20 minutes in a cafe in Amsterdam led to a breakthrough in _pathfinding_ algorithms. This algorithm was then later improved upon to produce _A*_ that makes the obvious decision to take into account the distance to the goal when searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to implement both _Dijkstra's_ algorithm and _A*_\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to break down how to turn these algorithms into functional code to solve simple grid based _pathfinding_. We did this by creating our own _Graph_ and _Priority Queue_ classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where do we go from here?\n",
    "\n",
    "As I am sure you have come to realize, there is always more to learn. _Pathfinding_ didn't reach it's apex in 1968. Since then researchers have pushed for more sophisticated ways of _pathfinding_ that don't rely on a grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such approach has been popularized by Sebastian Thrun, who used something called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) to win the DARPA Grand Challenge for self-driving cars. It maps out the cars location in real time while also performing _pathfinding_ using algorithms similar to _A*_\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of some good resources if you want to further your knowledge\n",
    "* [Udacity's free AI for Robotics coruse taught by Sebastian Thrun](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373)\n",
    "* [An academic paper on pathfinding in video games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267405818_Direction_Oriented_Pathfinding_In_Video_Games)\n",
    "* [A Wikipedia article about the Bellman-Ford algorithm that can be used on graphs with negative weights (something that Dijkstra cannot do)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)"

    "\n",
    "Below you will find two \"playgrounds.\" One for _Dijkstra_ and one for _A*_. Feel free to change anything below this point. If you discover you have broken something you can just rerun the code snippets in the main part of the notebook to undo any changes below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you should experiment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the cost for each terrain type in the _Graph_ class\n",
    "* Change the placement of the terrain and walls for any of the maps\n",
    "* Change how the _heuristic_ is calculated, such as Euclidean"
