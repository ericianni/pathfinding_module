    "Imagine you are a playing a turn-based computer game where you have a limited number of movement points per turn. Your task is to start at the village inthe top left and make it to the chest in the castle as quickly as possible without moving diagnolly.\n",

    "![Castle image](./images/castle_map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To you, as a human, it is very easy to see that the only clear path is around the North of the castle, back down the East and across the bridges in the South.  You are able to process the entire map at once and quickly identify dead ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To a computer this task isn't that easy. Computers are limited in how much of the \"big picture\" they can see and have to approach problems in single steps at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you are told that it is possible to cross water tiles, but there is a movement penalty. All of a sudden the task isn't so easy as you have to consider if swimming the moat is faster than the long way. Still, you can probably figure out that crossing the one water tile to the South-West is probably the fastest route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine it is possible to climb the castle walls, but with a stiff movement penalty. Can you still confidently say for sure you know the fastest path without sitting down and doing the math for multiple different routes?\n",

    "## What is Pathfinding?\n",
    "The simplest definition of _pathfinding_ is finding a route (_path_) between points *A* and *B*. We do this all the time everyday of our lives. When driving to the store we have to pick which streets to follow to get there. Even the simple act of crossing a room is an act of selecting a route, even more so if you have children leaving toys on the ground!\n",
    "\n",
    "While you or I use our eyes and intuition for many _pathfinding_ tasks, computers must rely on other approaches. Most computational _pathfinding_ makes heavy use of _graphy theory_. This involves defining the given situation as a _graph_: a series of nodes and edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this process, let's imagine a bus-network between a few cities: New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Columbus, and Chicago. To represent the network, we begin by designating each city a _vertex_ in the graph. We then create an _edge_ between vertices to mirror the bus-routes. Finally we can assign the number of miles between the cities as the edge _weights_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![City Graph](./images/city_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned how to frame a problem in a way for computers to understand, it is time to actually find a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dumb\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two algorithms we are going to examine are _Depth First Search_ (DFS) and _Breadth First Search_ (BFS). These two methods are what I would call _dumb_ in that they are brute force approaches to the problem of _pathfinding_. \n",
    "\n",
    "They get their name from how they search through _tree graphs_. DFS searches down a single branch until it reaches a leaf before it backtracks. BFS, on the other hand, searches each child node before moving onto lower levels of the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![DFS vs. BFS in Binary Trees](./images/binary_tree_search.png)(image borrowed from http://mishadoff.com/blog/dfs-on-binary-tree-array/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When not being used for _pathfinding_, DFS and BFS return a list of nodes in the order in which they were visited/searched. Given the binary-trees above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DFS would return **[0,1,3,4,2,5,6]** \n",
    "* BFS would return **[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's see these two in action!\n",

    "\n",
    "Below you will find two code snippets that implement DFS and BFS. You will be able to run these algorithms with different parameters to get a feel for how each search works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by simply running the cells (ctrl-enter) and trying different values for the starting node and the goal node. Try the same values for start and goal for each algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have experimented, try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why don't DFS and BFS come up with the same path?\n",
    "2. Why does BFS seem to be able to find shorter paths than DFS? (look at start: 'A' and goal: 'C')\n",
    "3. Pay attention to the number of steps required, why are they different?\n",
    "4. What does that mean for the value for each of these searches?\n",

For this we need a _Priority Queue_. While there are ready-made classes available we don't need all those features and they are easy to implement. For our purposes the _Priority Queue_ needs the following features:\n",

    "\n",
    "For our implementation we will use a simple List which we will call _Q_ (get it?). When adding elements to the queue we will simply append them to the list. To ensure that the highest priority element is on the top we will use the built in list _sort()_ function. This sorts from highest to lowest priority so when using retrieving the highest priority element we need to use _pop(0)_. The _empty()_ function will just check the length of the queue.\n",
