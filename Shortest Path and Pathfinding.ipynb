All of a sudden the task isn't so easy as you have to consider if swimming the moat is faster than the long way. Still, you can probably figure out that crossing the one water tile to the South-West is probably the fastest route.\n",

    "## What is Pathfinding?\n",
    "The simplest definition of _pathfinding_ is finding a route (_path_) between points *A* and *B*. We do this all the time everyday of our lives. When driving to the store we have to pick which streets to follow to get there. Even the simple act of crossing a room is an act of selecting a route, even more so if you have children leaving toys on the ground!\n",
    "\n",
    "While you or I use our eyes and intuition for many _pathfinding_ tasks, computers must rely on other approaches. Most computational _pathfinding_ makes heavy use of _graphy theory_. This involves defining the given situation as a _graph_: a series of nodes and edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this process, let's imagine a bus-network between a few cities: New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Columbus, and Chicago. To represent the network, we begin by designating each city a _vertex_ in the graph. We then create an _edge_ between vertices to mirror the bus-routes. Finally we can assign the number of miles between the cities as the edge _weights_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![City Graph](./images/city_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned how to frame a problem in a way for computers to understand, it is time to actually find a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dumb\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two algorithms we are going to examine are _Depth First Search_ (DFS) and _Breadth First Search_ (BFS). These two methods are what I would call _dumb_ in that they are brute force approaches to the problem of _pathfinding_. \n",
    "\n",
    "They get their name from how they search through _tree graphs_. DFS searches down a single branch until it reaches a leaf before it backtracks. BFS, on the other hand, searches each child node before moving onto lower levels of the tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![DFS vs. BFS in Binary Trees](./images/binary_tree_search.png)(image borrowed from http://mishadoff.com/blog/dfs-on-binary-tree-array/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When not being used for _pathfinding_, DFS and BFS return a list of nodes in the order in which they were visited/searched. Given the binary-trees above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DFS would return **[0,1,3,4,2,5,6]** \n",
    "* BFS would return **[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's see these two in action!\n",

    "\n",
    "Below you will find two code snippets that implement DFS and BFS. You will be able to run these algorithms with different parameters to get a feel for how each search works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by simply running the cells (ctrl-enter) and trying different values for the starting node and the goal node. Try the same values for start and goal for each algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have experimented, try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why don't DFS and BFS come up with the same path?\n",
    "2. Why does BFS seem to be able to find shorter paths than DFS? (look at start: 'A' and goal: 'C')\n",
    "3. Pay attention to the number of steps required, why are they different?\n",
    "4. What does that mean for the value for each of these searches?\n",

    "#### Priority Queue\n",
    "Now that we can represent our map as a graph, we need to have a way for Dijkstra's algorithm to keep track of our ever expanding list of nodes that need processing. For this we need a _Priority Queue_. While there are ready-made classes available we don't need all those features and they are easy to implement. For our purposes the _Priority Queue_ needs the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store all the elements\n",
    "2. Add elements to queue\n",
    "3. Sort elements so the item with the highest priority is at the front\n",

    "\n",
    "For our implementation we will use a simple List which we will call *Q* (get it?). When adding elements to the queue we will simply append them to the list. To ensure that the highest priority element (lowest cost to visit) is at the front we will use the built in list _sort()_ function. This sorts from lowest cost to highest cost so when using retrieving the highest priority (lowest cost) element we need to use _pop(0)_. The _empty()_ function will just check the length of the queue.\n",

    "_A*_ was developed in conjunction with trying to teach a physical robot pathfinding: the Shakey project. The algorithm was originally published int 1968, so over a decade after _Dijkstra_. What made it unique at the time was applying something called a _hueristic_ to help the search make better decisions when choosing which nodes to expand to next.\n",

    "Why wouldn't you look at roads that headed West? Obviously it is because you know that NYC is East of Corvallis and it makes most sense to look in that direction first.\n",

    "\n",
    "This _estimation_ of distance/direction to your _target_ is called a _heuristic_. If we know where we are starting and where we are going, we can do many things to estimate the distance. We can calculate it _as the crow flies_ or use something called _Manhattan distance_ (which we will be using) or any other way that suites our needs.\n",
    "\n",
